title: CareCentric Data Submission APIs
---

In addition to the standard CCAPI bundled, there are also a set of CareCentric APIs for submitting data into the shared record. These APIs allow API consumers to create new patient records, add data for community/mental health, social care, etc. and data submitted in this way is immediately available in the share record for others to view via the CareCentric interface or retrieve via APIs.

Access to the data submission APIs is restricted, please [contact us](mailto:adam.hatherly@graphnethealth.com) if you are interested in submitting data into the record in this way.

## Data Structures
Submitting data into the record requires some knowledge of the data structures, codes, etc. required. These are all defined in our existing feed specifications, which are available in the [Graphnet customer library](https://confluence.systemc.com/display/GTS/Graphnet+Technical+Specifications+Home) (login required â€“ [contact us](mailto:adam.hatherly@graphnethealth.com) if you need access to these)
