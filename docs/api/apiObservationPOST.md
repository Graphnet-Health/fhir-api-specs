## Overview

The **Observation** API can be used to add new observation records to a patient's record. The payload can be in either XML or JSON and must conform to the criteria for Graphnet Observations described in the [profiles](../profiles/Observation) section.

```http
POST /Observation
```

Note that observations created in this manner can also be updated or deleted by using the API as well.
