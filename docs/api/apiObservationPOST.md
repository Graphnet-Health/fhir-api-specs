The Graphnet FHIR APIs make use of the [FHIR STU3](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/index.html) CareConnect profiles developed by the [INTEROPen](https://www.interopen.org/) community where possible. On occassion, Graphnet specific profiles have been used so as to make provision for extensions that are not part of the CareConnect profiles.

When Graphnet specific profiles are used, the rationale for the profile is documented within this API guide.

The profiles are available from the [online profile repository](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/) hosted by [HL7 UK](https://www.hl7.org.uk/)

The profiles used by the Graphnet APIs are detailed below.
