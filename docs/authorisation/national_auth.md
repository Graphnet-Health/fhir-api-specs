title: Using National Identities

:::note

COMING SOON!

:::



We are currently actively working with NHS Digital, NHS England/NHSX and other suppliers on an approach for using national identities for authorising access to shared record APIs as part of the development of a Graphnet "LHCR" platform.

This should allow patients who have authenticated using [NHS Login](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/nhs-login/), and health/care professionals who have authenticated using [NHS Identity](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-identity), to use that same authentication (ID token) to be seamlessly authorised to access data via APIs in the Graphnet shared care record.
